# Welcome to Surf Journal!

This application is a way for **Surfers** to form patterns of when surf spots have optimum conditions. They can browse through the journals tab of their desired surf spot and get an idea of how the upcoming report will relate to what the Journals say. This is a way to get local knowledge without knowing the locals. The surf report information is web scraped from the magicseaweed.com website. I wanted to marry www.wannasurf.com and surfline.com. I see a gap in the market where surfers can get better forecasting with the marriage of human feedback (Journals) and digital forecasting (MagicSeaweed Report).

How to install and Test on your local computer

- Run git clone https://github.com/dmitchley/Surf-Journal.git

- Run `npm install` on the source and frontend directories.

- Create a .env file in the root directory and add your personal mongo db uri etc.

> NODE_ENV=development

> PORT=5000

> MONGO_URL=**YourURLGoesHere**

> JWT_SECRET=**YourSECRETGoesHere**

- To start the app run - `npm run dev` and wait for it to start. If all is done correctly you will see a link to the frontend that looks like the link below.

- âžœ Local: http://127.0.0.1:5176/

### Testing

- To test the backend run `npm run test` from the root directory.

- To test the frontend run `npm run test` from the frontend directory.

## Security Measures

The app uses jwt tokens that are validated by the backend every time a user signs in and this ensures security. I have hidden all the important keys in a .env file in the backend file to ensure no one can get hold of my mongo db url.

## Api

I could not unfortunately get a proper api endpoint for the surf report data. I decided to web scrape the magicseaweed website.

## Deployment

I originally planned to deploy the app to Heroku however they do not have a free tier anymore so I used render.com for the backend and vercel.com for the frontend. Render apparently offers options to deploy a frontend application however I am more accustomed to using vercel so I chose them instead.
